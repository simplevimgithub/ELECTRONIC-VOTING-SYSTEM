E-VOTING BACKGROUND AND REQUIREMENTS
Electronic voting has been an area of research focus for many years by using computing machines and
equipment for casting votes and producing high quality and precise results in accordance with the
sentiments of the participating voters. Various attempts have been adopted in practice to support election
process. Initially computer counting system allowed the voter to cast vote on papers. Later on, those cards
went through the process of scanning and tallying at every polling cell on a central server (Kadam et al,
2015; Rockwell, 2017; Hao et al, 2010). Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) voting systems were put in
place later on which were admired and acknowledged greatly by the voters in-spite of the resistance from
computer scientists. If the voting system is well understood by the voters, the system’s usability can be
increased remarkably. DRE systems in particular have gathered a lot of successes in bringing the voters
to use this technology. These systems work more or less in the same way as any conventional election
system does. In the case of DRE, a voter begins his journey by going to their polling place and get their
token to vote where he utilizes his token at the voting terminal to vote for his candidate. When the
candidate selection procedure is completed, DRE systems present the final selection to the voter before
actually casting it (in case if the voter wants to change his opinion) and after the final selection, the ballot
casting is completed (Multichain, 2017; Dalia et al, 2012).
More recently, distributed ledger technologies such as blockchain have been used to achieve e-voting
systems primarily due to their advantages in terms of end-to-end verifiability. With properties such as
anonymity, privacy protection and non-repudiation, blockchain is a very attractive alternative to
contemporary e-voting systems. The research presented in this paper also attempts to leverage these
properties of blockchain to achieve an efficient e-voting system. A detailed analysis of such systems is
presented in the next section along with the identification of comparison with these approaches.
e-Voting Requirements and Compliance by the Proposed System
The generic requirements for a typical e-voting system have been defined in (Rura et al, 2016). We
present a brief description of each requirement along with an explanation of how the proposed system
fulfils it.
Privacy - Keeping an individual’s vote secret
The system leverages cryptographic properties of blockchain to achieve privacy of a voter. More
specifically, as voter is registered into the system, a voter hash is generated by blockchain which is the
unique identifier of a voter into the blockchain, and is protected from misuse due to collision resistance
property of the cryptographic hash. Due to this, the traceability of a vote is also non-trivial thereby
protecting the voter when under duress.
Eligibility - Allowing only registered voters to vote, with each such voter voting only once
All eligible users are required to register using unique identifiers such as government-issued documents to
assert their eligibility. In addition to this, our system implements strong authentication mechanism using
finger printing technology to assert that only authorized voters can access the system. Furthermore, the
use of biometrics also enables the system to protect against double voting.
Receipt Freeness - Voters should be unable to prove to a third party that they voted in a
particular way
The proposed system enables a voter to vote as per their choice and creates a cryptographic hash for each
such event (transaction). This is important to achieve verifiability i.e. to verify if a certain vote was
included in the count. However, possession of this hash does not allow to extract information about the
way voter has voted.
Convenience - Voters must be able to vote easily, and everyone who is eligible must be
able to vote
The system has been implemented using a user friendly web based interface with the voting process
requiring minimal input from the user. For instance, fingerprinting is implemented for authentication
mechanism to avoid the requirement to remember username/passwords. Furthermore, the overall process
is integrated which enables the user to interact with it in a seamless manner.
Verifiability - The ability to trust the vote tallying process
Upon casting their vote successfully, a user is provided with their unique transaction ID in the form of a
cryptographic hash. A user can use this transaction ID to track if their vote was included in the tallying
process. However, this process does not enable a user to view how they voted which has been adopted to
mitigate threats when under duress.
The analysis presented above highlights the performance of the proposed system with respect to the
specific requirements of e-voting. It also highlights the significance of defining characteristics of
blockchain and their profound role in achieving the cornerstones of an efficient e-voting system.
Therefore, we believe the work presented here makes significant contribution to the existing knowledge
with respect to the application of blockchain technology to achieve a secure digital voting system.
RELATED WORKS
In (Kiayias & Yung, 2002), a self-tallying voting system is proposed that does not require any trusted
third parties for vote aggregation and any private channel for voter-to-voter privacy. The proposed
protocol involves extensive computation. In (Hao et al, 2010) a two round protocol is proposed that
computes the tally in two rounds without using a private channel or a trusted third party. The protocol is
efficient in terms of amputation and bandwidth consumption but is neither robust nor fair in certain
conditions (Dalia et al, 2012). In (Dalia et al, 2012) a protocol is proposed to improve the robustness and
fairness of the two round protocol (Hao et al, 2010). In (Shahandashti & Hao, 2016), authors propose E2E
verifiable voting system named DRE-ip (DRE-i with enhanced privacy), that overcomes limitations of
DRE-i (Chaum et al, 2008). Instead of pre-computing ciphertexts, DRE-ip encrypts the vote on the fly
during voting process. DRE-ip achieves E2E verifiability without TAs, but at the same time provides a
significantly stronger privacy guarantee than DRE-i. In (Chaum, 2004) end-to-end verifiability is
achieved through the Mixnet protocol (Chaum, 1981) that recovers the plaintext ballot in an unlikable
manner by randomizing the ciphertext through a chain of mix servers.
Scantegrity is proposed in (Chaum et al, 2008) that achieves end-to-end (E2E) verifiability with
confirmation codes that allow voters to prove to themselves that their ballots are included in the final tally
as they really are. Another scheme Prêt à Voter based on (Chaum, 2004) is proposed in (Chaum et al,
2005) that ensures privacy by constructing the ballot with two columns i.e. voting options are listed in one
column and the voter's choice is entered in an adjacent column. The work in (Adida & Rivest, 2006) is
based on Prêt à Voter but using homomorphic tabulation and it uses scratch stripes to allow off-line
auditing of ballots. Other systems that have been proposed for electronic voting include: Bingo Voting
(Bohli et al, 2007), Helios (Adida, 2008), DRE-i (Hao et al, 2014 ) and DRE-ip (Shahandashti & Hao,
2016), Star-Vote (Bell et al, 2013) and (Sandler et al, 2008) to name a few.
Fig. 1 Architecture for proposed e-voting system.
The existing approaches perform well for end-to-end verifiability without compromising the privacy of
voters. In (McCorry et al, 2017), authors presented the implementation of decentralized and self-tallying
internet voting protocol over the blockchain using Ethereum. Authors used the openvote (Chaum et al,
2008) e-voting approach as their baseline.
The focus of our research is to explore the exciting opportunities presented by blockchain technologies by
investigating their application in diverse application domains. Within this context, this paper presents our
efforts to develop an e-voting system by leveraging blockchain technology. To this end, our proposed
scheme fulfils the specific requirements for e-voting as discussed in section 2 and illustrated further in the
following sections.
PROPOSED SYSTEM DEISGN
The proposed e-voting system is based on the well-established Prêt à Voter e-voting approach identified
in (Ryan, 2008). The system has been designed to support a voting application in the real world
environment taking into account specific requirements such as privacy, eligibility, convenience, receipt-
freeness and verifiability. The proposed system aims to achieve secure digital voting without
compromising its usability. Within this context, the system is designed using a web-based interface to
facilitate user engagement with measures such as finger printing to protect against double voting. With a
clear need to administer the voters, constituencies and candidates for constituencies, a user-friendly
administrator interface is implemented to enable ease of access. Furthermore, the system allows all voters
equal rights of participation and develops a fair and healthy competition among all the candidates while
keeping the anonymity of the voters preserved. The cryptographic hash of the transaction (ID) is emailed
to the voter as a proof that the vote has been casted which may later on be tracked outside the premises of
the constituency.
Detailed Description of the Layered Approach
The proposed e-voting system architecture is presented in Fig. 1 and has been divided into several layers
to achieve modular design. These layers are described below;
User Interaction and Front-end Security layer is responsible for interacting with a voter (to support vote
casting functions) and the administrator (to support functions pertaining to administering the election
process). It encapsulates two key functions i.e. authentication and authorization of the users (voters and
administrators) to ensure that the access to the system is restricted to legitimate users in accordance with
the predefined access control policies. A number of different methods can be applied to achieve this
function ranging from basic username/password to more advanced such as fingerprinting or iris
recognition. Therefore these are rendered specific to individual implementation of the proposed
architecture. Overall, this layer serves as the first point of contact with the users and is responsible for
validating user credentials as governed by the system-specific policies.
Access Control Management layer is envisaged to facilitate layer 1 and layer 3 by providing services
required for these layers to achieve their expected functions. These services include roles definition, their
respective access control policies and voting transaction definitions. The role definition and management
provides core support for the access control functions implemented by layer 1 whereas the voting
transaction definitions support the blockchain based transaction mapping and mining performed at the
layer 3. Overall, this layer enables a coherent function of the proposed system by providing the
foundations required by individual layers.
e-Voting Transaction Management layer is the core layer of the architecture where the transaction for e-
voting constructed at Role Management / Transactions layer is mapped onto the blockchain transaction to
be mined. This mapped transaction also contains the credentials provided by a voter at layer 1 for
authentication. An example of such data can be the fingerprint of the voter. This data is then used to
create the cryptographic hash and contributes towards creating the transaction ID. The verification of such
credentials is envisioned to be achieved at User Interaction and Front-end Security layer (layer 1). A
number of virtual instances of nodes are involved in the process of mining to get this transaction finally
enter into the chain.
Ledger Synchronization layer synchronizes Multichain ledger with the local application specific database
using one of the existing database technologies. Votes cast are recorded in the data tables at the backend
of the database. Voters are able to track their votes using the unique identifier provided to them as soon as
their vote is mined and added into the blockchain ledger. The security considerations of the votes are
based on block-chain technology using cryptographic hashes to secure end-to-end communication. Voting
results are also stored in the application’s database with the view to facilitate auditing and any further
operations at a later stage.
The Voting Process
We now describe a typical interaction of a user with the proposed scheme based on our current
implementation of the system. Typically, a voter logs into the system by providing his/her thumb
impression. If the match is found, the voter is then presented with a list of available candidates with the
option to cast vote against them. On the contrary, if the match is unsuccessful, any further access would
be denied. This function is achieved using appropriate implementation of the authentication mechanism
(fingerprinting in this case) and predefined role based access control management. Furthermore, it is also
envisioned that a voter is assigned to their specific constituency and this information is used to develop
the list of candidates that a voter can vote for. The assignment of voter to a constituency is rendered an
offline process and therefore out of scope of this research.
After a successful vote-cast, it is mined by multiple miners for validation following which valid and
verified votes are added into public ledger. The security considerations of the votes are based on
blockchain technology using cryptographic hashes to secure end-to-end verification. To this end, a
successful vote cast is considered as a transaction within the blockchain of the voting application.
Therefore, a vote cast is added as a new block (after successful mining) in the blockchain as well as being
recorded in data tables at the backend of the database. The system ensures only one-person, one-vote
(democracy) property of voting systems. This is achieved by using the voter’s unique thumbprint, which
is matched at the beginning of every voting attempt to prevent double voting. A transaction is generated
as soon as the vote is mined by the miners which is unique for each vote. If the vote is found malicious it
is rejected by miners.
After validation process, a notification is immediately sent to the voter through message or an email
providing the above defined transaction id by which user can track his/her vote into the ledger. Although
this functions as a notification to the voter however it does not enable any user to extract the information
about how a specific voter voted thereby achieving privacy of a voter. It is important here to note that
cryptographic hash for a voter is the unique hash of voter by which voter is known in the blockchain. This
property facilitates achieving verifiability of the overall voting process. Furthermore, this id is hidden and
no one can view it even a system operator cannot view this hash therefore achieving privacy of individual
voters.

IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION
Implementation
The implementation of the proposed system has been carried out within a controlled environment with a
web-based application created to serve as the front end application enabling the users to interact in a
convenient manner. This application is implemented via Java EE within the Netbeans platform with
native Glassfish server used for hosting the application. Glassfish managed server side container for
holding the application’s EJBs and the data source. The application uses a MySQL as the backend
database for the application and contains the data entered manually by an admin such as the voter details,
constituency details and the information about different political parties running for the election. An
application screenshot demonstrating the admin function to view list of eligible voters is presented in Fig.
2. In addition to manual entries, the application also supports importing data using MS Excel spread
sheets to perform bulk import in view of the size of the data in real-world voting scenarios. We have used
Multichain as the blockchain platform to create a private blockchain for this application which is used for
recording the voting transactions. This choice is influenced by the ease of use provided by this platform
and therefore it was easily integrated into our proposed architecture.
Evaluation and Experimentation
The primary objective of evaluation was to assess the performance of the system in view of the e-voting
system requirements presented in section 2 and to identify any considerations with regards to its
application in a real world scenario. The experimentation consisted of multiple steps i.e. conducting
multiple transactions, verification of transactions, mining transactions into blockchain, reflection of the
changes made in the public ledger to all the nodes in the network and the usability of the system.
A test run was made directly at Multichain by starting from asset creation. An outcome of this is
demonstrated by Fig. 3. We can refer these assets as votes. Since Multichain by default ideally suits to
cryptocurrency, therefore we wrote our API’s to design it in the context of vote. In order to perform
transaction in Multichain, we identified the address and the balance in the address of the node of
Multichain from where the asset (vote) will be sent.
While sending the asset to the address, the transaction hash was generated carrying the transfer of vote.
The balance of the receiving node was incremented by one vote (asset). The transaction becomes a part of
the public ledger which shows that it has been mined. A sample transaction within the proposed system is
presented by Fig. 3. Since our customized API for asset creation is designed in such a way that an address
can have at max only one vote (asset), therefore, it will not be possible for a voter to caste multiple vote
unless the node receives it from some other address which is only allowed in the case of the candidate.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Electronic voting has been used in varying forms since 1970s with fundamental benefits over paper based
systems such as increased efficiency and reduced errors. With the extraordinary growth in the use of
blockchain technologies, a number of initiatives have been made to explore the feasibility of using
blockchain to aid an effective solution to e-voting. This paper has presented one such effort which
leverages benefits of blockchain such as cryptographic foundations and transparency to achieve an
effective solution to e-voting. The proposed approach has been implemented with Multichain and in-
depth evaluation of approach highlights its effectiveness with respect to achieving fundamental
requirements for an e-voting scheme.
In continuation of this work, we are focused at improving the resistance of blockchain technology to
‘double spending’ problem which will translate as ‘double voting’ for e-voting systems. Although
blockchain technology achieves significant success in detection of malleable change in a transaction
however successful demonstration of such events have been achieve which motivates us to investigate it
further. To this end, we believe an effective model to establish trustworthy provenance for e-voting
systems will be crucial to achieve an end-to-end verifiable e-voting scheme. The work to achieve this is
underway in the form of an additional provenance layer to aid the existing blockchain based
infrastructure.
